# Security Policy

## Current Project Status

This project is currently in an early development phase and has not issued any official release. It is not intended for production use, and we do not recommend deploying it in production environments at this stage.

We welcome and appreciate any vulnerability reports during this period. Since the project is open and evolving, public reporting via the GitHub Issue tracker is encouraged and considered an excellent way to contribute. Every valid security-related issue will be acknowledged openly, with our gratitude.

In the future, once production-grade releases are available, a different security policy will applyâ€”this will include private disclosure channels and coordinated fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you identify a potential security issue, you are welcome to open a public issue on GitHub describing the problem.

For sensitive issues, you may also contact us privately via email at **info@myndideal.com**, including:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Any potential impact
- Suggested fix or mitigation (optional)

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |

## Our Commitment

We are committed to building secure software and value community feedback. All valid reportsâ€”public or privateâ€”will be investigated, discussed, and resolved transparently at this stage. Future stable versions will adopt a stricter and more formal vulnerability disclosure process.
