# Overview of the GEO daemon

## Purpose
This document provides a technical overview of the main components in the GEO daemon, their responsibilities, and how they interact.

## Components
### 1. `geod.c`
**Role:** Main GEO daemon  
**Responsibilities:**
- Initializes the GEO daemon and starts core services  
- Handles Linux signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, etc.) for clean start/stop behavior  
- Manages the main loop and event handling (e.g., timers, housekeeper thread)  
- Implements an HTTP server to handle requests  
- Dynamically loads/unloads plugins (http request handlers)
- Dynamically loads/unloads the Map Generator module (`libmapgen_c.so`)  
- Supports fast, on-demand map regeneration  
- Generates textures for globe visualization:
  - biome (color)
  - elevation (terrain)
  - precipitation (clouds/alpha)  
- Caches generated textures based on file modification time and cache TTL  
- Manages "regions" (e.g., cities) with geographic coordinates and attributes  
- Randomly generates city names from predefined name patterns or lists  
### 2. `plugin.h`
**Role:** Plugin system  
**Responsibilities:**
- Registers plugins
- Loads plugins
- Manages plugin lifecycle
- Provides a plugin interface for the GEO daemon
### 3. `plugin_shape/plan.c`
**Role:** Plan generation for shape synthesis.
**Responsibilities:**
- Generates plans
### 4. `plugin_shape/shape.c`
**Role:** Shape synthesis and rendering.
**Responsibilities:**
- Generates shapes
- Probably it will generated 2D render later.
- json output ready data structure
### 5. `plugin_shape/plugin_shape.c`
**Role:** Plugin for shape synthesis and rendering.
**Responsibilities:**
- Manages shape synthesis and rendering
- Provides a plugin interface for the GEO daemon
- json export of the generated data.

# Map Generation Module â€“ Overview

## Purpose
This document provides a technical overview of the main components in the procedural terrain generation system, their responsibilities, and how they interact.

## Components

### 1. `mapgen.c`
**Role:** Main procedural map generation engine  
**Responsibilities:**
- Allocates and populates `MapPoint` array
- Uses Perlin/FBM noise for terrain features
- Performs elevation classification and biome color mapping
- Organizes processing in vectorized blocks for cache and SIMD efficiency

### 2. `perlin3d.c`
**Role:** 3D Perlin noise and fractal Brownian motion  
**Responsibilities:**
- Implements `perlin3()` and `fbm_noise3()` functions
- Supports scalar and SIMD-accelerated versions
- Provides LUT-based and polynomial `fade` options

### 3. `libmapgen.py`
**Role:** Python bindings and interface for testing or visualization  
**Responsibilities:**
- Loads `.bin` file generated by `mapgen`
- Interprets `MapPoint` records from raw binary
- Converts data to NumPy arrays for analysis or rendering

### 4. `run.py`
**Role:** Main execution entrypoint for map generation in batch or testing context  
**Responsibilities:**
- Calls into `libmapgen.py` to generate and optionally save the terrain map
- Allows CLI-based control of generation resolution and file paths

---

## Workflow

1. **Initialization:** `g_map` is prepared with memory allocation
2. **Noise Computation:** `fbm_on_sphere()` called per point using lat/lon
3. **Biome Classification:** elevation thresholds applied; RGB set
4. **Cloud & Precipitation:** Based on latitudinal parameters & additional FBM
5. **Save / Load:** `mapgen_flush()` writes binary, `libmapgen.py` reads it

## Data Layout

```c
typedef struct {
    short elevation;
    unsigned char r, g, b;
    unsigned char precip, temp;
    unsigned char flags;
} MapPoint;
